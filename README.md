## About Weather App

I developed a travel information and weather app using Vue.js and Laravel, showcasing the allure of Japan through carefully selected images. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing everyone to navigate effortlessly and enjoy the experience. With just a few clicks, users can access the information they need.

In terms of coding, I followed Clean Code practices and SOLID principles, ensuring that the implementation is not only robust but also easily understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
